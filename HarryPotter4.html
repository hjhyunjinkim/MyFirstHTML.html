  <h2>Quidditch</h2>
  <p><a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Quidditch" target="_blank" title="quidditch specification">Quidditch</a> (formerly known as Kwidditch and Cuaditch) was a wizarding sport played on <u>broomsticks</u>. It was the most popular game and most well-known game among wizards and witches, and, according to Rubeus Hagrid, the equivalent to Muggles' passion for football (Soccer).</p style="margin-bottom:45px;">

  <p style="margin-top:45px;">The object of the game was to score more points than your opponents. Each goal was worth ten points and catching <u>the Golden Snitch</u> was worth <strong>one-hundred and fifty points</strong>. The game ended when the Snitch was caught or an agreement was reached between the captains of both teams. Some games could go on for many days if the Snitch was not caught (the record, according to Quidditch Through the Ages, was six months, although no one caught the Snitch.)</p>
