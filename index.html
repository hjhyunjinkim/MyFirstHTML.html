        <a href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/" target="_blank" title="wizardingworld specification" style="text-decoration:underline">The Wizarding World</a> (previously known as J. K. Rowling's Wizarding World) is a fantasy media franchise and shared fictional universe centred on a series of films, based on the Harry Potter novel series by J. K. Rowling. The films have been in production since 2000, and in that time ten films have been producedâ€”eight are adaptations of the Harry Potter novels and two are part of the Fantastic Beasts series, with more films already slated to come out in the coming years. The films are owned and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, and three more are in various stages of production. The series has collectively grossed over $9.2 billion at the global box office, making it the third-highest-grossing film franchise of all time (behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Star Wars).
